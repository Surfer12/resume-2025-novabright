# Documentation Standards for Meta-Optimization Framework

## Overview

This guide establishes documentation standards for the meta-optimization repository, ensuring accessibility, maintainability, and community engagement while reflecting the transparency and systematic failure documentation philosophy central to the research.

## Documentation Framework

### Primary Documentation Tool: **Sphinx + Markdown**
- **Rationale**: Supports both technical API documentation and narrative explanations
- **Language**: Markdown for accessibility, with reStructuredText for complex mathematical notation
- **Auto-generation**: Automatic API documentation from docstrings
- **Integration**: GitHub Pages deployment for web accessibility

### Documentation Philosophy
Following the "Failure Museum" approach, documentation should:
1. **Embrace uncertainty**: Document confidence intervals, limitations, and known failures
2. **Provide transparency**: Include failure documentation alongside successes
3. **Support reproducibility**: Enable exact replication of experiments and results
4. **Foster community**: Lower barriers to entry while maintaining technical rigor

### 3. Code-Level Documentation

#### Python Docstring Standard (Google Style)
```python
def meta_optimize(task_spec: TaskSpecification, 
                 cognitive_constraints: CognitiveConstraints,
                 efficiency_requirements: EfficiencyRequirements) -> OptimizedSystem:
    """Implement meta-optimization across three frameworks.
    
    This function coordinates the integration of neuro-symbolic enhancement,
    cognitive-constrained optimization, and bias modeling to create a
    meta-optimized cognitive-computational system.
    
    Args:
        task_spec: Specification of the cognitive task to be optimized.
            Must include task type, performance metrics, and evaluation criteria.
        cognitive_constraints: Cognitive authenticity requirements.
            Includes R_cognitive parameters and plausibility bounds.
        efficiency_requirements: Computational efficiency constraints.
            Includes R_efficiency parameters and resource limits.
    
    Returns:
        OptimizedSystem: Configured system with optimized parameters.
            Includes α (integration weight), λ₁ (cognitive penalty), 
            λ₂ (efficiency penalty), and β (bias parameters).
    
    Raises:
        OptimizationFailureError: When optimization convergence fails.
            See failure documentation in docs/failure_museum/ for analysis.
        ConstraintViolationError: When constraints cannot be satisfied.
    
    Examples:
        >>> task = TaskSpecification(type="pattern_recognition", 
        ...                         target_accuracy=0.85)
        >>> constraints = CognitiveConstraints(authenticity_threshold=0.8)
        >>> requirements = EfficiencyRequirements(max_flops=1e9)
        >>> system = meta_optimize(task, constraints, requirements)
        >>> assert system.alpha in [0, 1]
        >>> assert system.performance_gain >= 0.11  # Conservative estimate
    
    Note:
        Performance improvements typically range from 11-27% (95% CI)
        depending on task complexity and constraint strictness.
        
        Known failure modes documented in:
        - docs/failure_museum/meta_optimization_failures.md
        - See Issue #XXX for convergence problems with high α values
    """
```

#### Mathematical Documentation Requirements
For mathematical functions, include:
- **Mathematical foundation**: LaTeX equations in docstrings
- **Parameter ranges**: Valid input ranges and constraints
- **Convergence properties**: When applicable
- **Numerical stability**: Known stability issues and mitigation strategies

Example:
```python
def compute_hybrid_output(symbolic_output: np.ndarray, 
                         neural_output: np.ndarray, 
                         alpha: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """Compute hybrid output H(x) = αS(x) + (1-α)N(x).
    
    Mathematical Foundation:
        H(x) = αS(x) + (1-α)N(x)
        where α ∈ [0,1] represents dynamic integration weight
        
    Args:
        symbolic_output: S(x), symbolic reasoning output
        neural_output: N(x), neural network output  
        alpha: Integration weight, must be in [0,1]
        
    Returns:
        Hybrid output combining symbolic and neural components
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If alpha not in [0,1] or array shapes incompatible
        
    Numerical Considerations:
        - Numerically stable for all α ∈ [0,1]
        - No special handling needed for boundary values
        - Consider numerical precision for α very close to 0 or 1
        
    Performance:
        - O(n) complexity where n is output dimension
        - Minimal computational overhead vs individual components
    """
```
