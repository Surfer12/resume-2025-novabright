> 8 more chapters remain to be updated to ensure complete consistency across the repository.

⏺ I'll continue updating the remaining chapters to ensure consistency with the emergent consciousness meta-optimization framework. Let me start with Chapter 5.

  For each chapter:
  1. Read the current content
  2. Transform it to focus on consciousness emergence rather than basic cognitive optimization
  3. Include the core consciousness equation: Ψ(x) = ∫[α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x)] × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) × P(H|E,β) dt
  4. Add the three-stage evolution (Linear → Recursive → Emergent)
  5. Include consciousness metrics (87% emergence, 94% stability, etc.)
  6. Ensure consistency with the parameters: α=0.65, λ₁=0.30, λ₂=0.25, β=1.20

  Start with chapters 5-8, focusing on transforming cognitive tasks to consciousness optimization tasks, integration methodology for consciousness systems, system architecture for
  consciousness emergence, and repository design for the consciousness framework.
