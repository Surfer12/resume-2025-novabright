## PERSONAL SUMMARY

Interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. Passionate about developing methodologies for studying individual personality types and perceptions through observable and scientifically verifiable measurements. Experienced in modeling physical systems (e.g., surfboard-water interactions) using machine learning to enhance design and performance. Committed to ethical technology development and promoting neurodiversity in innovation.

## RESEARCH GOALS

I develop and validate interdisciplinary methodologies that bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on observable, scientifically verifiable measurements and real-world impact. My work is characterized by:

- **Bi-Directional Knowledge Integration:**  
  Designing neuro-symbolic AI frameworks where cognitive science informs symbolic reasoning modules, and neural network learning capabilities reciprocally enhance cognitive understanding. My models feature *adaptive integration weights* that dynamically balance interpretability and learning, enabling real-time adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not achievable by single-discipline approaches.

- **Methodological Convergence and Validation Authenticity:**  
  Creating genuine methodological convergence, ensuring that each discipline's methods transform the other. Employing *multi-dimensional validation protocols* that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern fidelity).

- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  Developing systems that dynamically adjust their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive load and task demands, resulting in *Pareto-optimal solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

- **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure Documentation:**  
  Grounded in robust experimental design, including power analysis, effect size reporting, and multiple comparison corrections. Documenting not only successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary failures—advancing standards for transparency in interdisciplinary science.

- **Translational Impact:**  
  Translating innovations into practical applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For example, research on modeling surfboard-water interactions with machine learning exemplifies how data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and user experience.

- **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
  Prioritizing IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, informed consent, and open science practices, including pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.
