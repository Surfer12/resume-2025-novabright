## Professional Summary
Computer-science undergraduate (UCSB, pre-major) with a foundation in biopsychology and a passion for the science of human performance. Skilled in Java and Python, actively learning C/C++, Swift/Metal, and Modular's Mojo for high-performance computing. Interested in machine-learning applications that couple cognitive insights with efficient system design. Former student-government senator recognized for driving technology initiatives that improve learning experiences.

## Education
**University of California, Santa Barbara** — B.S. Computer Science (Pre-Major)  
- Relevant coursework: C/C++ programming, data structures & algorithms, discrete math  
- Previous focus: Biopsychology research on memory retrieval in VR environments  

**Cuesta College** — A.A. Computer Science (in progress)  
- Supplementary math & CS courses taken concurrently with UCSB studies  

## Technical Skills
### Languages
- **Java** — intermediate–advanced; design patterns, object-oriented architecture  
- **Python** — ML/data science basics (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)  
- **C / C++** — university coursework; memory management, pointers  
- **Mojo** — early-stage learning; performance-centric prototyping  
- **Swift & Metal** — exploratory graphics / iOS development  
- **YAML, Lua** — configuration & scripting for personal projects  

### Tools & Environments
- Git / GitHub  
- macOS Sequoia (M4 Max, 48 GB RAM)  
- Unix/Linux CLI  

### Areas of Active Learning
- Machine-learning model development & evaluation  
- System-integration / modular design patterns  
- Performance optimization & parallel computing  

## Projects & Research Interests
### Flow-State Optimization Prototype
- Designing ML experiments that correlate biometric/behavioral signals with "flow" indicators from extreme-sport sessions (surfing, kitesurfing).  
- Goal: Produce a lightweight model that predicts and prolongs optimal performance windows.

### Educational-Technology Advocacy
- As ASCC Senator, proposed data-driven learning tools that integrate probability concepts into curricula; conducted needs assessments with faculty and students.

### VR Memory-Systems Study (UCSB Biopsychology Lab)
- Helped design VR scenarios for spatial-memory testing; developed questionnaires and ran participants, sparking long-term interest in cognitive computing.

## Leadership & Community
**Associated Students of Cuesta College — Senator**  
- Championed campus-wide technology upgrades and open-source software adoption.  
- Coordinated workshops linking student developers with local tech mentors.

**Mentor & Tutor (Informal)**  
- Tutored peers in introductory Java and discrete mathematics, emphasizing conceptual understanding over rote syntax.

## Additional Strengths
- Interdisciplinary perspective merging neuroscience and CS  
- Resilient and self-directed—managing GAD/MDD has cultivated strong self-reflection and persistence  
- Comfortable in high-pressure, high-focus environments (advanced surfing, freediving, backcountry hiking)  

## Future Objectives
- Internships or research roles that fuse ML with human-performance or ed-tech applications  
- Teams that prize thoughtful design, ethical technology, and neurodiverse perspectives  
- Remote or hybrid work settings that allow deep, focused development time
