# Mojo Academic Research Workflow System

A comprehensive research workflow assistance system designed to support academic researchers in organizing, validating, and preparing research for publication while maintaining strict ethical standards and human oversight.

## Overview

This system provides tools to assist researchers like Oates R. in managing their cognitive science research on topics such as mind-wandering, recursive cognition, and attention dynamics. The system emphasizes:

- **Human-Centered Design**: All critical decisions require explicit human approval
- **Ethical Compliance**: Comprehensive checks for IRB approval, consent, and data privacy
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-stage peer review and validation processes
- **Reproducibility**: Support for open science practices and transparent methodologies

## Key Features

### 1. Research Identification & Organization
- Pattern-based recognition of research contributions
- Thematic clustering of related papers
- Automatic metadata extraction
- Author signature verification

### 2. Manuscript Development
- Structured abstract generation
- Journal-specific formatting
- Co-author management
- Theoretical framework integration

### 3. Validation & Review System
- Comprehensive peer review management
- Statistical validation checks
- Reproducibility assessment

### 4. Ethical Safeguards
- Mandatory IRB compliance checking
- Multi-stakeholder consent verification
- Institutional approval workflows
- Comprehensive audit trails

### 5. Human Oversight Requirements
- No autonomous publication capability
- Explicit approval required at all stages
- Timeout protections with automatic holds
- Appeal processes for disputed decisions

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the research workflow system
workflow = create_oates_research_system()

# Process a research paper
research_data = {
    "title": "Fractal Dynamics in Mind-Wandering Episodes",
    "background": "Mind-wandering exhibits recursive patterns",
    "methods": "fMRI analysis with fractal dimension calculations",
    "results": "Discovered scale-invariant attention fluctuations",
    "conclusions": "Attention operates as a fractal system",
    "framework": "recursive cognition",
    "co_authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K."
}

# Generate manuscript outline (requires human review)
manuscript = workflow.generate_manuscript_outline(research_data, "Cognitive Science")

# Create ethics compliance record
paper_id = str(hash(manuscript.title))
ethics = workflow.create_ethics_compliance_record(paper_id)

# Initiate human approval workflow
approvers = ["primary_author", "co_author_1", "co_author_2", 
             "department_chair", "ethics_board"]
approval_workflow = workflow.initiate_approval_workflow(paper_id, approvers, 14)

# Check publication readiness
readiness = workflow.check_publication_readiness(paper_id)
```

## Ethical Guidelines

### Mandatory Requirements

1. **IRB Approval**: All research involving human participants must have institutional review board approval
2. **Informed Consent**: Explicit consent required from all participants
3. **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance and anonymization protocols
4. **Author Consent**: All authors must explicitly approve submission
5. **Institutional Approval**: Required from affiliated institutions

### Human Oversight Checkpoints

1. Initial manuscript review
2. Ethics compliance verification
3. Peer review assignments
4. Final publication decision
5. Post-publication monitoring
