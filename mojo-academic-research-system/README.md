research_data = {
    "title": "Fractal Dynamics in Mind-Wandering Episodes",
    "background": "Mind-wandering exhibits recursive patterns",
    "methods": "fMRI analysis with fractal dimension calculations",
    "results": "Discovered scale-invariant attention fluctuations",
    "conclusions": "Attention operates as a fractal system",
    "framework": "recursive cognition",
    "co_authors": "Smith, J., Johnson, K."
}

# Generate manuscript outline (requires human review)
manuscript = workflow.generate_manuscript_outline(research_data, "Cognitive Science")

# Create ethics compliance record
paper_id = str(hash(manuscript.title))
ethics = workflow.create_ethics_compliance_record(paper_id)

# Initiate human approval workflow
approvers = ["primary_author", "co_author_1", "co_author_2", 
             "department_chair", "ethics_board"]
approval_workflow = workflow.initiate_approval_workflow(paper_id, approvers, 14)

# Check publication readiness
readiness = workflow.check_publication_readiness(paper_id)
```

## Ethical Guidelines

5. **Institutional Approval**: Required from affiliated institutions

### Human Oversight Checkpoints

1. Initial manuscript review
2. Ethics compliance verification
3. Peer review assignments
4. Final publication decision
5. Post-publication monitoring

3. **Not a Replacement**: Designed to assist, not replace, human academic processes
4.  **Compliance Required**: Users must ensure compliance with their institutional policies

## Personalization Notes

This system is designed to be adapted to specific research needs and institutional requirements. Here are some key areas you can modify:

### 1. Author Profile and Research Focus

-   **Update `AuthorProfile`:** Modify the `create_oates_research_system` function in `academic_research_workflow.mojo` to define the `AuthorProfile` for your specific researcher, including their name, domains, signatures, frameworks, and institution.
-   **Customize Research Patterns:** Edit the `create_oates_signature` function in `pattern_matcher.mojo` to refine the `ResearchPattern` list with keywords, types, weights, and context windows specific to the researcher's work and writing style. Adjust `minimum_confidence` and `combination_rules` as needed.

### 2. Validation and Review

-   **Modify Review Criteria:** Update the `_initialize_review_criteria` function in `validation_system.mojo` to add, remove, or adjust review criteria and their weights to match disciplinary standards or specific project needs.
-   **Manage Reviewer Pool:** Add or modify `PeerReviewer` entries in the `validation_system.mojo` to include relevant experts for assigning reviews. Enhance the `assign_reviewers` logic for more sophisticated matching or conflict detection.
-   **Refine Validation Checks:** The `validate_statistics` and `check_reproducibility` functions in `validation_system.mojo` contain placeholder logic. Extend these functions to integrate with external tools, scripts, or manual verification steps for more rigorous validation.

### 3. Ethical and Workflow Configuration

-   **Adapt Ethical Guidelines:** Modify the `create_ethics_guidelines` function in `research_config.mojo` to reflect specific institutional review board (IRB) requirements, data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and consent protocols.
-   **Configure Journal Requirements:** Update the `create_journal_requirements` function in `research_config.mojo` to add submission formats, peer review types, and ethical requirements for target journals.
-   **Adjust Workflow Safeguards:** Review and modify the `ResearchWorkflowConfig` and `create_workflow_safeguards` in `research_config.mojo`. Adjust `min_reviewers`, `approval_timeout_days`, `require_unanimous_approval`, etc., to align with institutional policies, ensuring that critical human oversight is maintained.
-   **Customize Approval Workflows:** Adapt the `initiate_approval_workflow` and `record_approval_decision` functions in `academic_research_workflow.mojo` to fit specific organizational structures and approval hierarchies.

### 4. Data Sources and Processing

-   **Integrate Content Streams:** The `identify_research_contributions` function in `academic_research_workflow.mojo` takes a `List[String]` `content_streams`. Extend this to integrate with actual data sources like local file systems, online repositories (with appropriate access), or internal databases, ensuring privacy and security.
-   **Enhance Metadata Extraction:** Improve the `_extract_paper_metadata` and `extract_research_metadata` functions to parse different file formats and extract more detailed information from research documents.

Remember to always maintain the core principle of **mandatory human oversight** for all publication-related decisions when personalizing the system.
