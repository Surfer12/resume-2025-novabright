## Research Highlights

### Key Performance Metrics
- **19% ± 8%** accuracy improvement (95% CI: [11%, 27%])
- **12% ± 4%** computational efficiency gains (95% CI: [8%, 16%])
- **22% ± 5%** cognitive load reduction

### Mathematical Framework
```
Ψ(x) = ∫[α(t)S(x) + (1-α(t))N(x)] × exp(-[λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency]) × P(H|E,β) dt
```

### Core Innovations
1. **Dynamic Integration**: H(x) = αS(x) + (1-α)N(x) with adaptive α
2. **Cognitive Regularization**: L_total = L_task + λ₁R_cognitive + λ₂R_efficiency
3. **Bias Modeling**: P_biased(H|E) = P(H|E)^β / [P(H|E)^β + (1-P(H|E))^β]
