# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Academic Integrity Addendum

In addition to general community standards, we are committed to:

1. **Transparent Science**: Documenting both successes and failures
2. **Reproducible Research**: Providing sufficient detail for replication
3. **Honest Reporting**: Including confidence intervals and limitations
4. **Collaborative Learning**: Learning from documented failures in our Failure Museum
5. **Attribution**: Proper citation of mathematical frameworks and prior work

## Failure Documentation Ethics

We encourage the documentation of failures as a form of scientific contribution:
- Failures should be reported without blame or shame
- Learning from failures is valued equally with reporting successes
- Failed approaches should be documented systematically
- Recovery strategies should be shared openly

## Enforcement

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 2.0, available at
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
